		 <br><p class="flow-text">Hello, and welcome to GhostCode's informational site about computer science and programming. The site is split into three sections: Investigate, interact, and integrate. Investigate will teach you about computer science, interact will allow you to try a bit of programming and integrate will give you some advice in how to include the wonders of computer science more into your life. Please remember that most of the content in here are placeholders, it does not represent the intended finsh of the final productand will be updated in a future build!</p>
		 <p class="flow-text">Computer science is not what most people think it is. What do you see when you think of computer scientists? Or programmers? I'm sure that the first picture that most people see is a person with glasses and a computer. Perhaps this is the first image you see?</p>

<p class="flow-text">He look like a loser, right? Well, actually, that's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates">Bill Gates</a>! If you don't know who that is, he basically created Microsoft. Oh, and he's also one of the richest people in the world! So, as you can see, computer science can take you far. Computer science is a subject that spans theory and practice. Computer science also has strong connections to other subjects. Many problems in science, engineering, business and other areas can be solved with computers. However, finding a solution requires both computer science expertise and knowledge of the particular subject. As a result, computer scientists will often be proficient in other subjects. 
<p class="flow-text">Computer science has a wide range of specialties. If you donâ€™t like the software engineering side (the programming) then there are other areas which include: computer architecture, software systems, graphics, artificial intelligence and computational science (although if you are new to computer science you need not worry about these right now, but if you are interested it is advised to go and research about them). Drawing from a common core of computer science knowledge, each specialty area focuses on particular challenges. </p>
<p class="flow-text">Computer Science as three main elements: maths, science and engineering. Maths, which is the origin of Computer Science, provides reason and logic that computers require to operate, science provides the methodology for learning and refinement of the subject and engineering provides the techniques for building hardware and software which allow the maths and science to come to life. </p>

<div class="container"><p class="flow-text">Computer Science is not just about computers. Rather it is the study of computation and information, and is a subject which involves you in the very make-up of the world, and over the last 30 years it has transformed the way we run our everyday lives.
<p class="flow-text">The home computer revolution brought a PC into every home. Now, the internet and social media have transformed the way that we communicate and the spread of information around the world.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Computer systems are all pervasive, ranging from the embedded system controlling a fridge to international banking systems handling billions of secure transactions every day. Many of these systems are very familiar, yet we take for granted the computational systems that make things like mobile phones, cars, aeroplanes and medical equipment possible.
<p class="flow-text">Computer Science has traditionally not been taught in schools. Rather, the use of software packages has been taught in ICT, which is a very different subject (a bit like the difference between knowing how to drive and knowing how to design and engineer a new car).

<p class="flow-text">As a subject, Computer Science requires logical thinking, creativity and problem solving. Since computer systems are now so large and complex, they are inevitably developed by large teams, so working well with others is also crucial. A Computer Science degree gives you the chance to study exciting new technologies as well as learning skills which will make you highly employable.
